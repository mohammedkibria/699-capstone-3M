I have 3 teenage grandchildren who grew up in the “red house” next to my “blue house” and now both houses are fully open for sharing extended stays with long term residents.  The houses are equipped for children of every age with art supplies, books, music, games, movies, etc.   

I always loved hosting house concerts, circle gatherings, and potlucks in my home and am enjoying taking this longtime  practice of hosting friends and family in my home to a new level with airbnb and other networks by hosting strangers that very often become friends. Since mid 2015, we made the shift at the Morningstar House to host guests for a 30 day minimum stay, so there's more continuity and just 3-4 guests sharing this huge home at any time. 
I spent 20 years traveling the world with my cultural work and my favorite way to visit any city is by doing a creative homestay with hosts that were sometimes friends, and sometimes friends of friends.  It's such a sweet way to come to know a city by having a safe, friendly, homey landing place. So that's what I want to offer now.  The spirit of hospitality comes naturally and easy to me.  My family used to say ""I never met a stranger""  I really enjoy people in all their variety and would be happy to provide you a good balance of quiet and private time, and also friendly, helpful support as you encounter Nashville.

The new owner of my daughters “red house” Marquetta Dupree will be starting to offer expressive arts facilitation and support to guests interested in that, and possibly even collaborate with guests to create concerts, workshops and other events in the PlayRoom which holds about 55 people for a concert, and 30 for workshops.  For an affordable and hospitable way to live for your time in Nashville come and be a part of this community.

I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view!  Leaves no doubt there is a God!  I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash!

UPDATE:  That's my first grandbaby...Walt!
UPDATE:  Angel's Landing hike at Zion National Park!!

I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. 

     I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street.

     I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view!  Leaves no doubt there is a God!  I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash!

I have a passion for community building across lines of race, class, and culture and have found work on the boards and staff of many church and community non-profit organizations, locally, regionally and internationally.

I am the oldest grandchild in a large farm family in Southern Tennessee and learned the fine art of hospitality from my ancestors, especially warm-hearted grandmothers and great-grandmothers.  There was a great synergy and sustainability in the collective, cooperative work of my large family, and in the 15 years I lived in the ""city"" I brought this ethic and value to my life in community there.  

After 10 years of leadership in the forms of InterPlay, we formed and were practicing with MorningStar Community Arts, linking arts and social transformation, writing, and performing. I've written poetry all along the journey and am currently publishing an extensive audio collection with a title something like:  Radical Hospitality: Grief, Grace and Grits. 

I love to travel and have been to Morocco several times to stay with extended family there. Hawaii and Australia are favorites, too. I have 3 teenage grandchildren who grew up in the “red house” next to my “blue house” and now both houses are fully open for sharing extended stays with long term residents.  The houses are equipped for children of every age with art supplies, books, music, games, movies, etc.   

I always loved hosting house concerts, circle gatherings, and potlucks in my home and am enjoying taking this longtime  practice of hosting friends and family in my home to a new level with airbnb and other networks by hosting strangers that very often become friends. Since mid 2015, we made the shift at the Morningstar House to host guests for a 30 day minimum stay, so there's more continuity and just 3-4 guests sharing this huge home at any time. 
I spent 20 years traveling the world with my cultural work and my favorite way to visit any city is by doing a creative homestay with hosts that were sometimes friends, and sometimes friends of friends.  It's such a sweet way to come to know a city by having a safe, friendly, homey landing place. So that's what I want to offer now.  The spirit of hospitality comes naturally and easy to me.  My family used to say ""I never met a stranger""  I really enjoy people in all their variety and would be happy to provide you a good balance of quiet and private time, and also friendly, helpful support as you encounter Nashville.

The new owner of my daughters “red house” Marquetta Dupree will be starting to offer expressive arts facilitation and support to guests interested in that, and possibly even collaborate with guests to create concerts, workshops and other events in the PlayRoom which holds about 55 people for a concert, and 30 for workshops.  For an affordable and hospitable way to live for your time in Nashville come and be a part of this community.

We have lived around the country--from the beaches of Florida, to New Hampshire clam chowder, to the windy streets of Chicago--and chose Nashville to lay some roots, get married, start a family, and call home. 

Life motto? Life is for the living.

What would it be like to have us as hosts? 
We have thought about what we appreciate when traveling and have made our apartment reflective of that. Local feel and flavor. Green space to go on a morning walk. Uber cozy, clean, crisp and modern accommodations. Privacy. A location that is central to experiencing the best Nashville has to offer.

When we travel, we don't just want to pass through--we want to get a feel for what makes this place so unique. We hope you will thoroughly enjoy not only our East Nashville Underground B&B, but Nashville beyond the traditional Broadway honky-tonks (Although Robert's Western World is still our honky-tonk jam). There is so much to do and see in and around Nashville. 

We have purposely filled our East Nashville Underground Air B&B with some of the most memorable Ryman concert posters, East Nashville roasted coffee, and other ""hats off to Nashville this is why we live and love it here"" decor. ENJOY!

Our firstborn, Adeline Grace arrived in July 2014 and our second, Jameson Owen arrived in January 2018. We couldn't be more excited to introduce them to all our wonderful Air Bnb guests from all over the country and world! For guests who may have questions about baby cries and coos...not to worry. Our home (upstairs) and apartment have pretty good insulation separating the two :)
We are very family friendly and can offer a pack'n'play and other baby gear/toys/swings if you are in need.
