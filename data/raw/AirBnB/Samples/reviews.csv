6422,1927,4/30/2009,14100,Melissa,"I can't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay here. It was the highlight of our stay in Nashville! Michele and her husband Collier felt like parents to my sister and I. They were so caring and helpful, giving us the best suggestions about places to eat and hang out in Nashville, and just being such warm, wonderful people that we had as much fun inside the house as we did going around Nashville! Also, the house was absolutely beautiful, and our room had a giant window looking out onto their backyard, which leads directly into a gorgeous park that we walked through every day. We felt so relaxed and happy there, it felt like home. We didn't want to leave!"
6422,3867,6/11/2009,17413,Raquel,"Michelle and Collier's home is wonderful! They are both great people, Michele always nice and friendly on the phone and Collier was very sweet to tell us about the places to be in Nashville at night. With his advice my friend Raquel and I had a wonderful time in Nashville! Everyone we met in their home was very warm, including their housemate Sally, she was a lovely lady. I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend anyone who is looking for a nice, comfortable place to stay and looking to meet very kind and genuinely good people to stay here. Thanks for everything =) Greetings from Miami!<br/>*Rachel"
6422,4159,6/17/2009,20253,Ulrike,"I spent one night at Michele's home and felt just wonderful and right at home. It's a beautiful place, and Michele and her family are all extraordinarily welcoming, open-minded, warm and generous. Would use more and better words to describe them if my English was better... If you're looking for a nice place to stay in Nashville and want to meet the nicest people, this is the place to be!"
6422,5724,7/18/2009,22544,Phil,"Michele and Collier are two of the loveliest people it has been our pleasure to meet. The whole family (and that includes Sally) welcomed us into their home and we were treated like old friends. I could not recommend this beautiful place any more highly, if there were ten stars they would get all of them. The suggestions of where to go and what to see were so helpful to a couple of Aussies a long way from home, I wouldn't think of staying anwhere else in Nashville. We made friends here and can't wait to come back, thankyou for everything."
6422,11891,9/29/2009,33409,Claire,"We had the most lovely time staying with Michele and Collier. We had just moved to Nashville - house hunting, car hunting, exploring and getting ourselves settled- and we could not have felt more at home! The house is beautiful, the area is great to explore.... really enjoyed being right near the greenway, such a beautiful area! Michele and Collier are the most lovely of people. Could not recommend this lovely little home highly enough. My only complaint is that we couldn't stay there longer! "
6422,14025,10/18/2009,9963,Kevin & Sally Ann,"My wife and I got back from a trip to Nashville and stayed at Michele and Collier's place.  Great accomodations and a great host (Michele was out of town, so it was just Collier).  Very friendly and helpful with the lay of the land.  Could come and go as we pleased and it is very conveniently located next to Shelby park on the river front which made for a nice morning run.  Also very close to downtown Nashville.  "
6422,15166,10/26/2009,31381,Elisabeth,"Michelle and Collier's home was safe and comfortable. We were welcomed and made to feel at home. The bed was comfortable and large. The room was private and had a great view. The pictures are very representative of the space. <br/><br/>This was our first experience with AirBnB, and all-in-all, my husband and I felt it was a good one. The price was very reasonable for the space, and the neighborhood was convenient to downtown (almost close enough to walk if you are in good shape). <br/><br/>Staying in someone's home is very different than staying in a hotel, but we had plenty of privacy, and all of the conveniences of being in a house. We would definitely stay with them again!"
6422,17031,11/12/2009,40552,Marcella,"We went from michelle and collier's home to the gaylord 's resort. The contrast was almost too much.  I want to go back to michelle's.  One is the real Nashville, the other is Disneyland."
6422,17499,11/16/2009,21423,Virginia,"Staying with Michele and Collier made traveling to Nashville a joy. Michele immediately enveloped me in her warmth, opening spaces for conversation and attending to every traveler's need. They were flexible and struck the right balance of allowing me privacy and being open and available. Their home beautifully reflects their adventurous spirit, with lovely colors and textures to explore everywhere. The room is large, comfortable, in terrific condition, and with everything I needed. The wooded setting provides lovely walking options. Highly recommended!"
6422,18193,11/24/2009,45962,Bec,No Words can really describe just how welcome I felt at Michele and Colliers.  Being a first time visitor to Nashville they were welcoming and had so much information about the surrounding areas and what to do.  I would recommend these guys to anyone wanting a comfortable stay for an incredible price....Will be back for sure!
6422,19350,12/6/2009,54759,Mark,"We stayed 3 nights at Michelle and Collier's beautiful home.  They welcomed my wife and I and our 3 children with graciousness and a warm hospitality beyond any of our expectations. These are the kind of hosts with whom you feel right at home and coversation relaxes and rich. Our rooms were very comfortable, spotless and -like the rest of the house - colorful and well furnished. Collier's breakfast biscuits were alone worth the trip from Maryland! Downtown Nashville is a short drive away, and their neighborhood quiet and pleasant, with many charming old houses. This was a wonderful experience and a true B&B experience in a big city neighborhood setting.  <br/>Mark and Melanie "
6422,24997,1/28/2010,68576,Kim,I stayed one night for a quick in and out trip.  I felt very welcome and comfortable as a single traveler.  The towels were great and the breakfast a nice treat.  The only thing no light at the bathroom mirror or good light to put on my makeup at night or under clouds. But hey I do it everyday so of course no clown left the house. If the opportunity arises again all the household members made me want to stay again at their great location.
6422,25926,2/12/2010,24253,Paul,"My husband and I instantly felt like part of the family when we arrived at Michele and Collier's place.  It is a great space and they are welcoming and lovely hosts.  Their house is clean, the room we stayed in was large and comfy, and their pets were a highlight for me.  Michele gives great recommendations of places to go.  Breakfast was nice even though we had plans most mornings we were there to go out to meet friends.  We would love to stay here again when we return to Nashville.  "
6422,26274,2/15/2010,50463,Alexandra,"Staying with Michele and Collier was the highlight of our trip to Tennessee! They went above and beyond to make their house feel like our home. It was clean, comfortable, quiet - we truly felt sad to leave! We really appreciated their many great suggestions of things to do / places to eat.<br/><br/>Great people, great pets, great house!"
6422,27222,2/21/2010,50463,Alexandra,Staying with Michele and Collier was so wonderful that we decided to stay with them again at the end of our trip. Their house really felt like our home.
6422,28974,3/10/2010,20253,Ulrike,"Coming back to Michele's house for the second time felt like coming home. Everyone there including the pets really make you feel like part of the family. Beware, you might never want to leave them again!"
6422,29654,3/15/2010,86234,Nicole,Staying with Collier and Michele was a true joy! They were so considerate and kind. Their home is absolutely beautiful and I absolutely loved staying there! I would recommend them to all my friends!
6422,32080,3/29/2010,82275,Monica,"When you stay with Michele and Collier, expect to never want to leave! Every morning was relaxing, and every evening when I returned, it felt like coming home. Michele and Collier are beautiful people, and so is the house!<br/>When staying here, be on the lookout for: extremely friendly cats, homemade bread, Collier-made recycled wine bottles-turned-glasses, enchantingly creaking floorboards, a listening ear(or 4), hidden light switches, an exciting amount of books, and intelligent conversation.<br/>All of these things are contained in a single house, which I'm pretty sure is magical, because from the street it looks like a little two bedroom houselet, but actually goes on forever. <br/>Thank you, Michele and Collier. See you again soon!"
6422,37468,4/23/2010,75040,Steve,"Great house and great hosts.  Big beautiful, clean room with lots of natural daylight, facing a park.  Adorable cats and dog. Many good tips on what to do in Nashville (BTW you must see the Doyle and Debbie country music spoof). Delicious home made breakfast.  When we return to Nashville, we'll stay here!! :)  Thanks Michele and Collier for making us feel at home."
6422,37890,4/25/2010,9963,Kevin & Sally Ann,This was our second time staying at Michele and Collier's place and overall- another great stay. Great location in East Nashville and is so close to downtown which was convenient for us  since we were there for an event.   Very homelike feel and they are very friendly.  Their pets are fun to have around too!
6422,38900,4/30/2010,100381,Lucy,"We LOVED it! Michele and Collier provided us with a home away from home and we couldn't have been more grateful. Their generosity and kindness was so wonderful, their house in a beautiful area close to everything you could need while not feeling like you're stuck in the middle of the chaos of a city. Couldn't have asked for anything better :)"
6422,105482,9/26/2010,198785,Tim,"Nashville would have been a good experience no matter what accomodation I'd found, but staying with Michele, Collier, Ben and Sally in a big, lively, inviting atmosphere of home and happiness made it a truly wonderful experience. All these reviews confirm the quality and friendliness of the house and its' convenience for the city, so I have no hesitation in pointing out something that's not so perfect...the dog and the piano both need tuning!<br/>Thanks M & C for being so generous spirited and kind and for being such good and interesting ambassadors for Nashville!"
6422,119708,10/15/2010,231363,George,"We were very happy staying with Michele and Collier.  Their home is lovely, they are lovely, and also full of good suggestions on things to do and see while visiting Nashville."
6422,132388,11/2/2010,221090,Maggie,"Staying with Michelle & Collier is what Airbnb should be like everywhere; a shared experience of family, friends (& of course Nashville) with 2 of the loveliest people I've met on my travels.  I cannot recommend a stay more highly than this. If you're heading down South but kinda wide of Nashville, make a detour! You won't regret it. The location is brilliant - just a short drive from all that downtown offers which was more than I expected.  But what made this stay hit all the buttons was the open, generous and kind-hearted welcome I received and the interesting conversations we shared as political/ cultural sympaticos.  I didn't want to leave but thank you both for everything. I'll keep in touch.  Maggie x"
6422,135229,11/8/2010,244778,Heather,"Michelle and Collier are such great hosts and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Their house is located in a convenient location in Nashville, close to downtown and the freeway and they have a nice park right behind them. They make the best bread and coffee. We will definitely be back for another visit!"
6422,141281,11/18/2010,232251,Jim,They were kind and the scones were fabulous : ) 
6422,183137,2/16/2011,86655,Lynne,"We stayed for 4 nights in a visit to determine if Nashville would be our new home. We enjoyed the camaraderie, the great coffee, excellent breakfasts, clean room and bathroom, and we had enough privacy as well. Overall, it's just the perfect spot to stay if you want to feel like you are visiting friends."
6422,187461,2/23/2011,305731,Rebecca Sharon,"I felt right at home with Michele and Collier. They helped me navigate Nashville as a first time visitor. Great location, great people, I'll definitely be a regular!"
6422,188938,2/26/2011,365311,Victoria,"We could not recommend staying here more. We had an absolutely fabulous time here!! Everything about our experience was wonderful. We loved the house and the guys just filled it with such energy. We could have just moved in, we were sad to leave. Hopefully we'll get to see Michele and Collier (or any member of the gang) on our soil as they are more than welcome, otherwise we'll be back!! "
6422,214536,4/1/2011,434295,Jan,"This was our first time staying in a private home instead of a hotel.  We were a bit ill at ease when we arrived but that feeling soon melted away.  Michele, Collier and their family were wonderful, friendly hosts.  My 16 year old son and I enjoyed our stay and will likely stay with them again while in Nashville.  Their home was clean, a simple breakfast was available to us, and we fell in love with their little white dog and red cat.  Southern hospitality at it's best!"
6422,234349,4/21/2011,479182,Lauren,"Truly enjoyed my stay, and was delighted by the home-made scones and delicious coffee in the morning!  I cannot recommend these folks enough!"
6422,236599,4/23/2011,86655,Lynne,"This was my second stay with Michelle and Collier. Once again everything was perfect.... happy people, good advice, adorable dog and cats, and yummy food. What more could I ask for?"
6422,415833,8/2/2011,200563,Josh,"Jessa and I had a wonderful 3 days staying with Michele and Collier! They gave us a great orientation to Nashville and we had some wonderful conversations about activism, social justice, and life. They are incredibly welcoming and we would stay with them again in a heart beat. The house is large and charming, and the East Nashville area is equally charming. If you like walking there are some great restaurants and music venues within about 15 minutes walk."
6422,437800,8/11/2011,813923,Davinia,"Michelle's house was absolutely beautiful and she and her family were fantastic hosts. She kindly left us a delicious breakfast every morning and the room we stayed in was very clean, comfortable and cosy with two beds.<br/><br/>Their house is in a lovely neighbourhood a short bus ride away from the centre of town.<br/><br/>Thank you so much Michelle for a wonderful stay - it was one of the real highlights of our trip."
6422,523279,9/12/2011,880294,Aaron,"Michele and Collier extended us every courtesy during our stay and certainly went above and beyond their call of duty.  We enjoyed meeting their family and friends and felt immediately welcome in their home.  During our stay, we felt that we had the perfect balance of privacy and familial interaction and truly felt welcome in every regard.  They have a beautiful and unique home, which aptly reflects the personalities that inhabit the space.<br/><br/>Bonus points for their cat who thinks she is a dog and wags her tail as if she was one.  "
6422,543442,9/18/2011,1099347,Kathleen,"We couldn't have asked for better hosts! Michele, Collier and the whole household were generous, warm and helpful. Had some great conversations over a delicious home cooked breakfast!<br/>They went out of their way for us - not only did they drive us to the Greyhound Station at the end of our trip, but they even turned around and drove back when they realized that we left our packed lunch in their car.<br/>The house was beautiful and the location was great. Wish we could have stayed for longer."
6422,560954,9/23/2011,1143912,Kim & Phil,"We had a wonderful stay with Michele and her family during our visit to Nashville. Each detail -from fresh towels to fresh-baked scones and coffee in the morning- spoke of a comforting home away from home. Everyone was kind and accommodating -so much so, it made us sad to have to leave.  "
6422,575795,9/27/2011,1159399,Ron,"Anita and I just returned from our visit to Nashville.  We couldn't have asked for better hosts!  Michele, Collier and the whole household were just great. They went out of their way to help us feel welcome and comfortable.  They gave us so many suggestions of places to visit it will take another longer trip to see them all, which we are currently talking about.  Of course this is where we will stay again, the house was beautiful and the location was fabulous.  "
6422,587622,10/1/2011,1204582,Breanna,"Michele and her husband we so kind during our quick stay in Nashville. The room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable, perfect after our long road trip! Michele even provided a list of places to visit in New Orleans she received from another visitor, which we planned to visit the following week on our road trip (we ended up relying on a lot of those tips!). Next time, we'll be sure to stay in Nashville longer."
6422,597640,10/4/2011,1108790,Diane,"I was absolutely blown away by everything about my stay. I won't repeat what everyone else has said, but I will agree wholeheartedly with every word. Michele, Collier, Ben and Rebecca were perfect hosts--there when you needed or wanted them, but never intrusive. I never felt a moment's awkwardness--rather, a sense of genuine warmth and hospitality. Sunday brunch was to die for--everything made from scratch, organic and REAL food! I was in town for Wilco concerts at the Ryman, and when I mentioned to Michele that the weather was surprisingly chilly at night, she just loaned me her fleece pullover without a moment's hesitation. That in itself might not be so remarkable, but it's indicative of the friendly, unassuming, totally charming nature of the home and the happy and generous people who live there. This was not only a lovely place to stay, in an amazing neighborhood, but it was also soul nourishing. "
6422,607842,10/8/2011,437804,June & Joe,"Made to feel very welcome in spite of arriving during a family crisis, we hope Collier is making a good recovery. it wasJust like staying with friends.Nice accommodation with easy access to downtown Nashville. Had a great time, thanks to you all."
6422,624025,10/12/2011,1211854,Jessica,"They were my first and best host I have had! They made breakfast every morning or at least made sure we had something to eat or drink. Very loving and warming home. They knew all the hot spots of Nashville! I will recommend this host to anyone wanting to visit Nashville. It was a great location, not to far away and not to close. "
6422,684792,11/1/2011,411514,Kyle,"Michele and Collier were a joy to be around! They truly felt like family. It was a quick trip for us, but we felt right at home. Their home is very cozy and clean. We had everything that we needed. Michele and Collier were also very helpful when it came to giving us information about the city and things to do. And, Michele makes an amazing breakfast! We recommend Michele and Collier's home to anyone! If we are in the Nashville area again in the future, we will definitely being staying with them again! "
6422,712186,11/12/2011,1363768,Kristine,"My friend and I came to Nashville for a busy three nights of country music events and visiting friends and family. Michele and Collier were perfect hosts. They were two of the nicest, most welcoming people I've met. They had a room set up for us, and always made sure we had something to eat in the morning for breakfast. The house was at a great location which was awesome for going around town. Our only regret was not being able to spend more time with them. I will defiently stay here again when I come to Nashville. I enjoyed it much more than a hotel stay :) Thanks Michele and Collier! "
6422,717868,11/14/2011,1341399,Cara,"My husband and I went to Nashville this past weekend to meet our good friends' new baby! We would normally stay with them but because it is such a delicate time in their home we wanted to stay overnight somewhere else. Michele and Collier live 3 blocks from our friends! The location couldn't have been better. Michele and Collier were very accommodating to what our wishes were. We arrived later (around 9pm) and just wanted to bathe and sleep (tired from our drive up) and to get up and go. A quicky, if you will. I slept like a rock in their guest room, in fact, I slept in until 9! Which is so unlike me. I think this was because we felt so comfortable in their home. We will definitely request to stay again when visiting Nashville and will tell all of our friends about Michele and Collier's colorful cozy home. "
6422,728706,11/18/2011,1110898,Katie,"We were checking out Nashville as a potential living location, and Michele was an incredible hostess.  She and her husband Collier were very warm, hospitable, and accommodating.  They gave us wonderful information about neighborhoods in Nashville and where to go.  The area they live in--East Nashville--is also a great neighborhood with nearby independent coffee shops and restaurants.  Plus, it's all very safe and easy access to all of Nashville, including downtown.  Highly recommend!"
6422,737490,11/22/2011,1306712,Jake,"We had a wonderful experience staying in Michele and Collier's home. Michele and her family (including the dog and two cats!) were very welcoming, and did everything they could to make us feel at home. The next time we are in Nashville, we will definitely look her up."
6422,840047,1/5/2012,89110,Michael,The host canceled my reservation 8 days before arrival.
6422,845829,1/6/2012,1200004,Clare,Thank you so much Michelle and Collier! We had such a pleasant stay and loved the hospitality. 
6422,858890,1/12/2012,1545273,Sinora,"This was my 1st experience staying with an airbnb and I would have to say, I picked one of the BEST people to stay with. Michelle and her family made me feel like I was a part of theirs. It felt like I've known them forever. They gave us the low down on the ins and outs of the city. Next time I visit Nashville, I'll be back to see them. "
6422,1414873,6/4/2012,2441450,Mary,"From the moment I arrived, I felt welcome and at home, but also enjoyed a sense of total privacy.   There were fresh flowers from the garden and coffee better than Starbucks!  In fact, would never consider another option when I'm in Nashville.   Plus the house was lovely and I enjoyed being in an amazingly cool neighborhood within a short drive to downtown.         "
6422,1464419,6/12/2012,1701061,Casey,"Michelle and her family were so welcoming, we felt like part of the family. Would highly recommend staying at Nashville Charm to anyone."
6422,1475673,6/13/2012,2313811,Teresa,"Had a great time with Michelle, and family and friends. I arrived at dinner time and was invited to have a yummy home-cooked meal. Great house, nice people, good time. Thanks! <br/>Contacting Michelle the day before arrival was a little slow; Did have to try a few methods of contacting her before I heard back from her (the late morning/afternoon of arrival)..but being new to air BnB, it could be that I just wasn't using the right method. I tried her email, then her personal phone, <br/>then air BnB text..that worked best and I heard from her pretty soon after air bnb text."
6422,1683860,7/11/2012,2536211,Alicia,Michele and Collier were fantastic hosts!  This was our first airbnb experience and we had a good time.  They provided great suggestions for exploring Nashville and made us a delicious breakfast.
6422,1730939,7/17/2012,2451815,Alex,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in Nashville. The house was beautiful and our room was spacious. The Flynns made us feel very welcome and were extremely helpful in telling us about all things Nashville. Also, they have adorable pets! For the first time using airbnb I feel like we were very lucky. I highly recommend them for your stay in Nashville. "
6422,1808474,7/26/2012,2874075,Matthew,"The first thing I had to do when I stepped inside this room was take a moment to adjust to all the space I had! There was a work desk, a couch, and of course a large bed all spread out in the large room. Collier and Michele were both very hospitable, friendly hosts and I enjoyed talking and getting to know them both. The location of this home is also a steal because of it's close proximity to the downtown area. I highly recommend that you reserve this room on your next stay in Nashville. "
6422,1831797,7/29/2012,1205410,Frédérique,Michele and her husband are wonderful hosts. I really felt at home when I arrived at their place.The large TV in the bedroom was perfect to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. Their breakfast was delicious. Her homemade scones with honey and fresh figs from her tree with a large cup of coffee made me start the day strong and wide awake for my road trip. I enjoyed chatting with them and would make sure to stop at their place again when I plan another trip in Nashville. 
6422,1872418,8/2/2012,1445389,Jess,We really enjoyed staying with Michele and her family. The room is very spacious and comfortable. We had a very restful experience. The breakfast provided was delicious! We also had a fantastic brunch with her family and friends. Michele is a great host and we would highly recommend her. 
6422,1881225,8/4/2012,1642164,Benoit & Segolene,"What a story!! It was just fantastic... <br/>It's maybe the first time that behind the ""pay-to-stay"" logic we felt a true sense of sharing, a true sense of sharing humanity. And that's not French rhetoric it's real. The breakfasts were tastefully perfect and reflected the reason why we do love this place and its people. Michele, Collier and Rebecca are genererous, smart, helpful and funny people. They are both interested and interesting persons. <br/>It's easily understandable, it is THE place to stay in when being in Nashville!!!!<br/><br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH"
6422,1919657,8/7/2012,3096859,Britt,"What a great place to stay! I'm from Nashville and I have to say this was such a better choice than booking a hotel, which I normally do when visiting. The location is great, just minutes from all of East Nashville's best. Michele was so welcoming and made us feel right at home. The space is very peaceful and serene, and the view of the park was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again!  "
6422,1928294,8/8/2012,49785,Barrett,"Michele and Collier were great hosts, and the space was wonderful.  The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and nice desk, windows overlooking the park.  The location is ideal for East Nashville, and I would have loved to spend more time there.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Nashville."
6422,1977582,8/13/2012,2872201,Gisle,"Great hosts, great value, great location. Perfect :) :) I totally recommend this place. BIG room, cozy animals. Very hospitable and friendly people :)"
6422,2003839,8/16/2012,1034669,Raffael,"Nice, clean, big room. Very, very hospitable guest. We felt so welcome like we are old family friends. We had a parking spot right outside and its only a 5 min drive to downtown Nahsville."
6422,2050964,8/20/2012,1470072,Katrina,Great Folks! We felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our time with this boisterous family. Would highly recommend.
6422,2077289,8/23/2012,2872201,Gisle,These guys are just the best :) And for that price? Top-Notch .
6422,2104015,8/26/2012,3229431,Kieran,"We enjoyed a lovely stay with Michele in her beautiful Nashville home. Our GPS guided us to the door and Michele met us, she was warm and friendly and instantly made us feel at home. The room is very large and clean with a great view of the park, and we effectively had a bathroom to ourselves. Michele went out of her way to be helpful to us and advise us on places to see (definitely eat at Mas Tacos if you have a chance), she even gave us a ride into town and made us a delicious breakfast. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer and get to know her better. We hope to return to Nashville someday and would definitely stay with Michele again. "
6422,2139665,8/29/2012,2864169,Matt,I loved staying at Michelle's! I had a nice big room with a sofa and TV. The location was also great! Michelle was an excellent host. She was very friendly and gave me some great suggestions on places to go around town. I had a great experience!
6422,2155825,8/31/2012,2864169,Matt,My room was very spacious with its own sofa and a beautiful window that viewed a park. Michele and Collier were great hosts and made my stay very comfortable! I would recommend this place to anyone!
6422,2174907,9/2/2012,3340154,Gina,The kindest people in a great neighborhood!
6422,2238696,9/9/2012,2918265,Jarrad & April,"Michele and Collier were awesome hosts. They were very inviting and helpful. Everyday Michele told us where the best places were to hang out and meet the most interesting people in Nashville - most of the time it was right in their own home. The house is very communal, the conversations and interesting and fun! They were also very understanding when I had a family emergency pop up that cut our trip short. <br/><br/>Thanks Michele and Collier! "
6422,2326147,9/17/2012,1901327,Amy,"I feel lucky I got to stay here. A smart, gracious, wise, and laughter filled household.   The room is spacious, lovely, and has a comfortable bed.  The bathroom is perfect.  All the house is really extraordinary with love written all over it.  These are really good folks.  Great neighborhood in the heart of east Nashville.  Thank you Michele and family for having me and sharing all your kindnesses."
6422,2440962,9/28/2012,2256486,Bex,"Michele is one of the nicest people I have met, not just on Airbnb, but in Nashville! I don't usually leave long reviews, but their home was so so great! Her husband Collier was really nice too! They made me feel so at home and the spread that they put on for breakfast in the morning was AMAZING!! The room was super spacious and the value for money was superb! I wont be staying anywhere else in Nashville when i come back next year! "
6422,2495641,10/3/2012,1227415,Clint,"What a wonderful Tennessee trip! It was a little rainy on my two extra days in town, but I did my best to take advantage of it.<br/><br/>Michele Flynn is the sweetest host and goes above and beyond to make your stay feel warm and welcomed. Fresh towels, access to do laundry, spacious bedroom with internet availability, and a natural view out of the room's window (no houses).<br/><br/>I had a chance to explore quite a bit of the area including 5-Points (local hangout), downtown Nashville, nearby parks and rivers.<br/><br/>Just behind the property within walking distance is an incredible park & golf course. I was especially pleased with seeing the amazing train trestle and took full advantage of the running trail that begins below it. A great area to breathe in the fresh air and view the river and ponds.<br/><br/>The residence is located in the perfect place for nearby shops and bus transportation. The home is very cozy and warm with friendly pets and beautiful book collection upstairs.<br/><br/>Everyone was very respectful of noise. <br/><br/>I will certainly be going back in the future to stay with Michele again. Such great people and a wonderful neighborhood."
6422,2543180,10/8/2012,2514527,Gale,"we had a great time in Nashville. Really enjoyed the neighborhood that Michell's house was in , nice biking path. Very easy to get to and  from the  downtown also. Collier and Michelle were great hosts, we enjoyed our conversation with them and laughted alot at the stories. My husband love the hammock on the porch. The breakfast was very good. loved the scones. The room was bright and airy. We would stay here again if we return to the area. We loved the little town of Centerville that we went to."
2521338,34606505,6/9/2015,8055207,Nate,"Patricia and John were very welcoming and helpful, especially since I requested to book last minute. They provided easy directions for being able to get into the place later than expected--due to flight delays--which was awesome. They had keyless entry on the door which meant I didn't have to worry about forgetting a key or needing to wake anybody up when I arrived."
2521338,74006955,5/12/2016,60364714,Tanisha,I really enjoyed my stay with Patricia and John. The room was extremely comfortable and cozy. Both were very welcoming and available while I was there. I would definitely stay again!
2521338,92965511,8/10/2016,71651923,Harry,Need to advise all newcomers to Airbnb that the stays do not include breakfast so it is not a true BnB. 
6422,2580768,10/11/2012,1841327,Joan,"Staying with Michelle & her husband, Collier, was wonderful!  They were very welcoming & offered to pick  us up at our bus stop.  My daughter & I felt right at home-especially having pets close by. We felt like we were with extended family & were treated as such.  They are awesome hosts!"
6422,2606402,10/14/2012,175080,Thomas And Stephanie,"We spent a Friday night at this lovely home. Michele had been called out of town suddenly, but her husband was a wonderful host. We had some great conversation and a super night's sleep. The view from the bedroom is wonderful, and the cat Serendipity was very welcoming. We are now trying to figure out a reason to come back to Nashville so we can have an excuse to spend another night at this home! <br/>Also, there are lots of cool eating places nearby in five points. "
6422,2636892,10/16/2012,2030151,Molly,Wasn't able to make it but Michelle was very easy to communicate with and very helpful! Next time im south I will be checking her out!
6422,2748963,10/29/2012,3719038,Aurélie,Perfect! Michele was very nice and helpful. Will definitely stay there again next time I'm town!
6422,2791714,11/3/2012,1473171,Matthew,"Talk about Southern hospitality... Everything about my stay with Michele and Collier was marvellous, from the pick-ups and drop-offs to the adorable pets and the homemade biscuits for breakfast. The room is spacious and comfortable, the house is well-located (next to a bus stop or about an hour's walk from downtown), and I felt at home from the moment I arrived. Michele and Collier are generous, big-hearted people and good company - will definitely stay there again next time I'm in town."
6422,2819991,11/5/2012,266595,Holli,"Everything was fantastic at Collier and Michele's lovely home! The art of hospitality is not lost on these two, and I've never been in the home of a stranger and felt more like family! Their home is eclectic and lovely and all the members of the house are simply a delight to be around. The homemade breakfast scones and all the delicious foods on the brunch menu were fantastic, and the conversation made it difficult to leave! I can honestly say that every time I visit Nashville, I will return to their house for my stay. Thank you all so very much for such a memorable experience! "
6422,2883047,11/13/2012,4106410,Meredith,"Just stayed for one night to go to a concert, but wish that we could have stayed longer!  Their house is so cute and Michele and her husband are extremely nice! Their animals are also very sweet.  I spent a few hours cuddling with their cat Jelico. In the morning Michele made us fresh biscuits that tasted delicious!! If we ever go to Nashville again, I will definitely stay here!"
6422,2910428,11/18/2012,1887407,Kate,"Michele was a wonderful host.  Very welcoming.  She took the time to give me some recommendations for exploring the city, and baked marvelous pumpkin muffins for breakfast.  The room itself is bright and spacious, and the bed is comfortable.  Peaceful, but very convenient to Nashville.  I had a wonderful time!"
6422,2931053,11/20/2012,2441450,Mary,"This was my second time staying at this wonderful Nashville Airbnb.  As they say the ""second time is a charm"" and as happened with my virst stay earlier this year, this time around was absolutely comfortable and I now consider staying with hosts, Michelle and Collier, who are warm and accommodating, a requirement to for my visits to Nashville.  The house is immaculate and the neighborhood is really great and walkable to nearby places; and within a few minutes to downtown Nashville and all major expressways.   "
2577619,16886742,8/4/2014,14194549,Tim,"Enjoyed the stay at Glenn and Debbie's! House was as listed, neighborhood was safe and downtown attractions were within walking distance. There were enough beds and couches to accommodate our group of 8."
2577619,18300419,8/25/2014,14435596,Debbie,Great house in a great location. Short taxi ride to Nashville centre. Debbie was very welcoming and gave us lots of useful information
2577619,21192250,10/13/2014,1546028,Allison,"Along with seven friends, I stayed at Nashville's gem location for our 5th Vanderbilt Reunion. The location is wonderful-- walkable to Vandy's campus and some of our other favorite spots as undergrads. It rained all weekend, so we were especially glad to have a place where we could hang out and make meals together! I would highly recommend the place for big groups-- between the second and the first floor there were five beds plus a cot and sofa bed. Thanks for the wonderful stay Debbie and Glenn!!"
2577619,21575227,10/20/2014,15184011,Saul,Great neighborhood. Debbie was a great host. Very available and eager to make sure that all was going well. House was perfect for a large group. 
2577619,22575886,11/10/2014,16260913,Margareta,"Wonderful location, great layout for hanging out, perfect for large family or groups.  House was clean, beds comfortable, and hosts had everything was ready when we arrived. We would gladly return!"
2577619,22881852,11/17/2014,18344980,Kim,"The house was in a great location and close to everything we wanted to do and see while in Nashville. The house was adorable and the floor plan was easily able to accommodate the 10 of us staying in the house. The kitchen was beautiful and had an open design that allowed everyone to gather in that same space. The beds and comforters were extremely comfortable!!<br/><br/>The owner called and let us know the people that rented prior to us had broken the sink in the downstairs bath and she was just made aware of that before we ""moved in"" for the week. It made it a bit of an inconvenience, but there was another sink near the broken one. <br/><br/>The house was comfortable and my family agreed that we would stay there again if we do another family trip to Nashville. "
6422,3003545,12/1/2012,4185808,Maryjean,Michele was extremely welcoming. The room was comfortable and spacious. I wish I could have staying longer. It was a great place to stay. 
6422,3067965,12/11/2012,4227354,Sallie,"Michele and her husband Collier were very welcoming hosts for my one week stay.  My room was very comfortable.  I awoke every morning with fresh fruit and all the fixings laid out for me on the kitchen counter along with a new note from Michele wishing me a productive day.  At the end of my stay on Sunday, they invited me to join them and their friends for a brunch in the dining room.  I came and went as I wished, and they made me feel quite comfortable for my first time using airbnb.  They come highly recommended.  "
6422,3095677,12/16/2012,299259,Jim,"Our stay with Michele and Collier was a highlight of our time in Nashville. Our hosts were kind and welcoming (everything from the perfect room to the delicious coffee and breakfasts) and gave us helpful tips on how best to navigate the city. By the time we left, it felt like we were saying goodbye to old friends.<br/><br/>We can't wait to visit Nashville again, and will hopefully make ""Nashville Charm"" our home base again!"
6422,3321789,1/10/2013,4272357,Janice,"Michele and her family welcomed us with open arms and a hug, which was a nice thing after a 9 hour drive. She had a map for us, regarding the places we wanted to go and things we wanted to do. Even though we only spent one night in her house it was a fabulous experience. Her home is beautiful. I appreciate the breakfast that she left us in the morning and the key they let us use to let ourselves in and out. "
6422,3339590,1/13/2013,195311,Corey,"Thinking about moving to Nashville, I needed a place to do recon from. Michele and her whole family were extremely accommodating to my plans, helpful, friendly and full of good advice. The house was comfortable and very convenient. We may stay there again!"
6422,3363383,1/17/2013,4581873,Inder & Andy,"We couldn't have asked for, or imagined, better hosts than Michele and her husband! The accommodations were inviting, warm, and more than comfortable, despite the stormy weather outside. Such generous hosts! Our stay was the perfect introduction to the Nashville community. We will certainly be back! Or sending friends :)"
6422,3394320,1/22/2013,4500305,Laura,"Comfortable and excellent stay for our first visit to Nashville (and first Airbnb stay)! Michele and Collier were so welcoming and nice. We could not have asked for a better host family! Our room was very spacious, bed was great, bathroom was clean, and towels were out for us. We loved how close the house was to downtown. We recommend Michele's home to anyone. They make you feel right at home! "
6422,3459926,2/2/2013,548044,Sam,"Michele & Collier are the perfect hosts, and it's a true pleasure to stay with them in their home. They're so welcoming and friendly and made sure i felt like part of the family, straight away. The pets are gorgeous too, especially Serendipity the cat. This is definitely my #1 pick whenever i visit Nashville"
6422,3579903,2/19/2013,4101399,Lori,"Michelle and her husband Collier were delightful hosts.  We felt at home the minute we entered their home, which was in a quiet residential area of lovingly restored homes.  Their home bordered a park and the bedroom wall was lined with windows looking out onto the park.  Very nice!  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate.  My stay included a Sunday and Michelle prepared a delicious brunch which included eggs, homemade biscuits, fresh fruits and vegetables.  Michelle and Collier were both very attentive hosts and were always concerned that we were enjoying our stay.  Their location was easily accessible(by car) to The District and other Nashville attractions.  My friend and I really enjoyed our stay at Nashville Charm!  "
6422,3631235,2/26/2013,4219009,Amy,"What a perfect stay! Michelle & her husband Collier are genuinely lovely people, and such wonderful hosts. We really liked their house, the spacious, comfortable room, the neighbourhood and Nashville, and would recommend coming here. They were both attentive and helpful, answering our questions and engaging in conversation, even inviting us to Sunday morning brunch with them, which we will always remember"
6422,3655015,2/28/2013,4956449,Anna,"Michele was a wonderful host.  The house was comfortable and the perfect place to stay in a very nice and interesting part of the city. She gave us great advice about where to go in the city and was warm and kind from the moment we met her. We loved our stay with her and would recommend it to anyone going to Nashville. <br/>Thanks very much!!<br/>-Anna & April (Roadtrippin' gals from Montreal, Canada)"
6422,3670290,3/2/2013,1324978,Mike,"Michele is a warm,personable,genuine and spiritual woman who is most welcoming and helpful.Her generosity of spirit adds to her light.Her spouse,Collier,is a very engaging,interesting,intelligent and lucky man,<br/>whose love for the law is evident.Their house is the most homelike<br/>airbnb place to date.A willingness to go the extra mile to make one feel welcome is heartwarming.<br/>If you can't feel comfortable here,forget it.<br/>Michele's sweet tart offering in the AM with a note gave my stay that special something extra.Her gift of homemade corn bread for the road was to die for.<br/>My only regret is that I hadn't planned to stay longer.<br/>Their home is a definite keeper.Thanks ever so much."
6422,3737330,3/10/2013,4667191,Ryan,"Great place, great location and great price!  This was my first airbnb stay, and Michelle was more than hospitable, and very helpful if you're looking for Nashville advice.  (They told me to eat dinner at Mas Tacos, and those were some of the best tacos I've ever had).  <br/>Their description says you don't have a private bathroom, and while that is technically true, it's all pretty darn private upstairs, it's almost like a suite.  The bed can be a little hard on the hips, but this is a great value with very nice people.  "
6422,3879501,3/24/2013,4940925,Lauren,Such a great experience staying here. Michele and her husband made us feel very at home-we didn't want to leave! We also loved that we could easily walk downtown in 45 minutes. Thank you again!!!
6422,4102120,4/9/2013,5664753,Georgia,"Michele's brother is ill so she was not there while I stayed in the house, but her husband Collier greeted me, gave me a key and towels and set up my breakfast for me. The house is beautiful and in a cute little neighbor-- it was so easy to get around Nashville from their place! The room was clean and comfortable, the internet worked great and the bathroom was great too. This was my first Air B n B experience and I couldn't have asked for a better one!"
6422,4171328,4/15/2013,5507817,Alice,"This is by far our best airbnb experience yet! Our room was LARGE and with big windows overlooking a nearby park. But that is not the best thing. The hosts Michele and Collier are the sweetest people one could ask for. Michele took care of everything before we got there, but had to leave before our stay, so we spend a lot of good times in the kitchen with Collier, who tells the greatest stories and is simply wonderful to be around and helpful to an extent which is more than you would ever ask for. In short, book with these guys, we promise you will never regret it!"
6422,4228426,4/20/2013,5649192,Grace,"We had a wonderful stay at Michele's house.  When we arrived she was heading through town so was kind enough to give us a lift to hers and show us some places to go in East Nashville on the way. <br/>The room is really spacious, it has a laundry room attached to it and the internet's very fast.  I'd agree with an earlier review that the bathroom feels very private too - it's right next to the room and is rarely used by anyone else. <br/>The location is good - easy walking distance to a cluster of lovely bars and restaurants in East Nashville and walking to downtown took about 50mins. There's also a bus which goes from almost right outside the house and takes about 10 mins to get to downtown.<br/>Breakfast was lovely everyday - homemade biscuits and scones. <br/>It really was such a great place to stay, and incredible value - the house is gorgeous, we felt really welcome and it's a great location. If we're ever back in Nashville we'd definitely want to stay again. "
6422,4233586,4/21/2013,3484737,Brii,"This was my second stay with Michele and Collier, and just as last time, they were incredibly hospitable. Very welcoming to new guests, and gave my friends tons of information about jobs and moving to the area. They made us feel as if we were part of the family, and very accommodating. Thanks for such a great stay!!"
6422,4254967,4/22/2013,5774518,Lincoln,"Michele & Collier could not have been more wonderful hosts! From the moment I walked in the door, they made me feel like family. They have a beautiful old house, and the room I stayed in looks out onto a park. The accommodations are more than adequate and match the description in the listing very well, but it's really the spirit with which guests are welcomed that sets this Airbnb apart. When I arrived, the Flynns were more than happy to take time out of their day and engage me in great conversation, sharing stories about their family and Nashville history. They had superb recommendations for what to check out in the area (East Nashville, by the way, is highly recommended - a quiet neighborhood with a vibrant nightlife and beautiful architecture, and reasonably easy to get to from downtown via public transit). I was lucky enough to stay on a Sunday morning and enjoyed a delicious family-style brunch. As a first-time Airbnb user, I was apprehensive about what the experience would be like. Before my arrival, the Flynns were great about being flexible around my travel arrangements and responded quickly to all my communications. I couldn't imagine a better introduction to the service - this amazing couple clearly doesn't offer their home just to use their extra space, but they see it as a form of service and a way to extend, in their words, ""radical hospitality"" to whoever is lucky enough to stay with them. Couldn't recommend them enough!"
6422,4316001,4/27/2013,3782274,Nikki,"Michele's inviting and beautiful house is a home away from home. Nestled in and among our new favorite hang outs and neighborhoods, this is a treasure for people seeking out all sorts of adventure and experiences. We had to tear ourselves away from their adorable pets as we loved our mornings with them. Michele is such a gracious host and made us feel incredibly welcomed. Nashville quickly ranked among our favorite cities with the friendliest folks around, delicious food, and amazing local haunts within walking/biking distance. Between the gorgeous home and the perfect location, the wonderful hospitality, the delicious breakfasts Michele created for us, the loving pets, the great conversations (the list could go on and on...) -  we can't wait to come back and visit Michele again. FIVE STARS!!!"
